# PopularTasks

Custom solutions for popular tasks.

The purpose of it is to practice skills that I have, such as OOP, unit testing, git workflow, problem solving.

## Usage

The current version is intended for preview only.

So far I have only implemented sentence reversal. You can download the source file and play with the unit tests. You can also run the console application and write custom strings in the console.
